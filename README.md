# Project Management Web App

This is a full stack web app with CRUD functionality to manage clients and projects. 
User can create clients with their name, email and phone. Then we can query clients with GraphQL Queries to get the only data we need.
User can create projects and associate client with it and can set status to "Not Started", "In Progress" and "Completed". Afterwards user can update the projects details or can delete the project.
The status setting on project is achieved with GraphQLEnums which let's us choose from the available three key and their associated values.
